Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is a branch of computer science that deals developing, testing and mainting software
Importance:
Ensures reliability-it is reliable for critical application such as heathcare systems or communication systems whereby data breaches and cyber threats are a less risk
Scalabilty; Important in handling large load without affecting perfomance of software systems
improved effeciency;helps software enginners use better methodologies for better resource usage
promotes innovation:by using better software businesses can be able to boost themselves techwise and increase profit
ensures high quality software:software development follows structured mrethodologies which 
lead to bug free and efficient software and also through continous testing

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity:the challenges of managing increasing complex software systemsleading to structured better programming
Mastering process:development of methodologies like 'agile methodology' to improve effciency and quality
Mastering machine:optimizing software to work effectiveky with evolving hardware

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning;identify the purpose of the software
requirement analysis; identify the final user specification
Design;involves building the framework 
Coding;involving building the software into tangible code
Testing;for examing bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Approach:
Waterfall methodology;it is usually linear and sequential and each phase is completed before moving on to the next
Agile;usually interative and incrementa:the project is developed int o small  cycles 
Flexibility:
Waeterfall is stiff and makes changes after the whole phase is completed
agile is higly flexible allowing change at any stage(adaptive to change)
Customer feedback:
waterfall,customer feedback is slow and comes late
Agile: regular customer feedback

Waterfall methodology is best for fixed projects where the is little change required for example banking systems which adheres strict security protacals 
Agile methodology is best for projects that require frequent updates  for example applications such as facebook or instagram or e commerce platforms 
that require frequents updates

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER:
developing applicatications,programs amd systems
maintaining and updating software and ensure it is functional
collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
Reporting to the manager about the development of the software 

QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINNER:
collaborates with stakeholders to understand software requirements
create standards and procedures for programmers to follow
confirms that a software meets requirements before it is deployed

PROJECT MANAGER:
Creates blueprint for the project
assembles and lead the software development team.
tracking and communicating information regarding the project coverage
deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
iNTERGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT(IDEs):
Debuggin has built in debugging tools that fix errors easily
project management by organising files for large projects
it can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
it compiles or converts  code into a simplified language for the operating system to understand
EXAMPLES:
Visual studio code(vs)

VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM(VCS)
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors
Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
eg. Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

TIME IS CONSTARINED:Software engineering requires alot of time as it is usually large projects
solution;adopt agile methodologies to divide the work into manageable sprints
Limited Infrastructure : limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
 Software Security :Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Changing Software Requirements : Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.




Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests ;are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. ;it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests ; verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing; Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests ;are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience ; Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
Increased flexibility ; A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control ; Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a picture of a person;

Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
